# Qubits

NetSquid simulates physical quantum information processing systems: quantum computers and quantum
networks.

NetSquid contains various generalized classes to represent and manipulate qubits. These generalized
classes are used as building blocks to implement simulations of specific quantum technologies, such
as nitrogen vacancy centers (NV), atomic ensembles, ion traps, etc.

NetSquid supports three quantum formalisms to internally represent the state of a single or a group
of entangled qubits:
 
 * Ket state formalism
 
 * Density Matrix (DM) state formalism
 
 * Stabilizer state formalism

A brief introduction to qubit state representation and manipulation in NetSquid is provided at
https://docs.netsquid.org/latest-release/overview.qubits.html (login required).
